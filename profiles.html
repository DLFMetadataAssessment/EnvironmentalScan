        <h2>Metadata Mappings &amp; Profiles Clearinghouse</h2>
        <p><em>DRAFT</em></p>

        <p>The Metadata Profiles & Mappings Clearinghouse is intended to be a clearinghouse for metadata profiles, mappings, or related specifications. There are 2 main goals: </p>
        <p>The Clearinghouse would help give folks an exemplar or an ideal to measure their metadata against, especially when it can be hard to find ways to compare, analyze and validate metadata against schemas or profiles increasingly not within the wheelhouse of technologies like XML.</p>
        <p>The Clearinghouse would be way to share common work within the metadata and digital repositories community.</p>
        <p>The starting scope for this project is to focus on primarily digital repository descriptive metadata documentation and specifications. However, this does not preclude inclusion of other metadata types or sources in the Clearinghouse, nor does it mean that future iterations of this work won’t broaden the scope.</p>
        <p>Notes on this goal:</p>
        <p>“maps” here could be mappings, metadata application profiles, or other related documentation/specifications. </p>
        <p>It could also be expanded in some ways to also trying to centralize knowledge around the tools used to manage or assess data against these metadata specifications. This overlaps possibly with the tools exploration/expansion goal in 2017.</p>
